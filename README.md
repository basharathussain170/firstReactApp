# My First React Project

This is my first project created using React. I built it to practice React basics, JSX, components, props, and states.

## About the Project

- This project is created using **Create React App**.
- It contains a simple component structure to understand React fundamentals.
- Practiced how to render elements dynamically and use CSS styling.
